class Transaction(object):
    """The :class:`Transaction` object, which represents a transaction
    on Stellar's network.

    A transaction contains a list of operations (see :class:`Operation
    <stellar_base.operation.Operation>`),
    which are all executed in order as one ACID transaction, along with an
    associated source account, fee, account sequence number, list of
    signatures, both an optional memo and an optional timebound. Typically a
    :class:`Transaction` is placed in a :class:`TransactionEnvelope
    <stellar_base.transaction_envelope.TransactionEnvelope>` which is
    then signed before being sent over the network.

    For more information on Transactions in Stellar, see `Stellar's guide
    on transactions`_.

    :param str source: A strkey encoded account ID (public key) of the source
        account for the transaction.
    :param dict opts: A dict that contains the primary components of the
        transaction. The following keys are searched from the dict:

        * opts.sequence - The current sequence number of the source account.
          The sequence number is incremented by 1 automatically, as is
          necessary for a new transaction for a given source account.
        * opts.time_bounds - A list of two Unix timestamps representing the
          lower and upper bound of when a given transaction will be valid.
          NOTE: This should likely be an object containing a minTime and
          maxTime attribute instead, and the implementation may change.
        * opts.memo - The memo being sent with the transaction, being
          represented as one of the subclasses of the
          :class:`Memo <stellar_base.memo.Memo>` object.
          Defaults to :class:`NoneMemo <stellar_base.memo.NoneMemo>`.
        * opts.fee - The fee amount for the transaction, which should equal
          FEE (currently 100 stroops) multiplied by the number of
          operations in the transaction. See `Stellar's latest documentation
          on fees
          <https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/fees.html#transaction-fee>`_
          for more information.
        * opts.operations: A list of :class:`Operation
          <stellar_base.operation.Operation>` objects (typically its
          subclasses as defined in :mod:`stellar_base.operation` to be
          included in the transaction. By default this is an empty list.
