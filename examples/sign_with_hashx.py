Hash(x)
Adding a signature of type hash(x) allows anyone who knows x to sign
the transaction. This type of signer is especially useful in atomic
cross-chain swaps which are needed for inter-blockchain protocols l
ike lightning networks.

First, create a random 256 bit value, which we call x. The SHA256 hash
of that value can be added as a signer of type hash(x). Then in order to
authorize a transaction, x is added as one of the signatures of the transaction.
Keep in mind that x will be known to the world as soon as a transaction is
submitted to the network with x as a signature. This means anyone will be able
to sign for that account with the hash(x) signer at that point. Often you want
there to be additional signers so someone must have a particular secret key and
know x in order to reach the weight threshold required to authorize transactions
on the account.
