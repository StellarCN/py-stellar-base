Stellar Python SDK
==================

py-stellar-base is a Python library for communicating with
a `Stellar Horizon server`_ and `Soroban-RPC server`_. It is used for building Stellar apps on Python. It supports **Python 3.9+** as
well as PyPy 3.9+.

It provides:

- a networking layer API for Horizon endpoints.
- a networking layer API for Soroban-RPC server methods.
- facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with a Stellar Horizon and Soroban-RPC instance, and for submitting transactions or querying network history.

Quickstart

At the absolute basics, you'll want to read up on `Stellar's Documentation
Guides <https://developers.stellar.org/docs/>`_, as it contains a lot of
information on the concepts used below (Transactions, Payments, Operations,
KeyPairs, etc.).
