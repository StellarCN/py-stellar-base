        3. verify that transaction has time bounds set, and that current time is between the minimum and maximum bounds;
        4. verify that transaction contains a single Manage Data operation and it's source account is not null;
        5. verify that transaction envelope has a correct signature by server's signing key;
        6. verify that transaction envelope has a correct signature by the operation's source account;
