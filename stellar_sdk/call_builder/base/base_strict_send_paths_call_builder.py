    """Creates a new :class:`StrictSendPathsCallBuilder` pointed to server defined by horizon_url.

    The Stellar Network allows payments to be made across assets through path
    payments. A strict send path payment specifies a series of assets to route a
    payment through, from source asset (the asset debited from the payer) to
    destination asset (the asset credited to the payee).

    A strict send path search is specified using:

    - The source asset
    - The source amount
    - The destination assets or destination account.

    As part of the search, horizon will load a list of assets available to the
    source address and will find any payment paths from those source assets to
    the desired destination asset. The search's source_amount parameter will be
    used to determine if there a given path can satisfy a payment of the desired
    amount.

    See `List Strict Send Payment Paths <https://developers.stellar.org/api/aggregations/paths/strict-send/>`__ for more information.

    :param source_asset: The asset to be sent.
    :param source_amount: The amount, denominated in the source asset, that any returned path should be able to satisfy.
    :param destination: The destination account or the destination assets.
    :param horizon_url: Horizon server URL.
