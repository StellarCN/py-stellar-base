class TransactionBuilder:
    """Transaction builder helps constructs a new :class:`TransactionEnvelope
    <stellar_sdk.transaction_envelope.TransactionEnvelope>` using the given
    :class:`Account <stellar_sdk.account.Account>` as the transaction's "source account". The transaction will use
    the current sequence number of the given account as its sequence number and increment the given account's
    sequence number by one. The given source account must include a private key for signing the transaction or
    an error will be thrown.

    Be careful about **unsubmitted transactions**! When you build a transaction, stellar-sdk automatically
    increments the source account's sequence number. If you end up not submitting this transaction and submitting
    another one instead, it'll fail due to the sequence number being wrong. So if you decide not to use a built
    transaction, make sure to update the source account's sequence number
    with :func:`stellar_sdk.server.Server.load_account` or :func:`stellar_sdk.server_async.ServerAsync.load_account`
    before creating another transaction.

    An example::

        # Alice pay 10.25 XLM to Bob
