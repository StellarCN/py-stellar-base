    """Transaction builder helps constructs a new :class:`TransactionEnvelope
    <stellar_sdk.transaction_envelope.TransactionEnvelope>` using the given
    :class:`Account <stellar_sdk.account.Account>` as the transaction's "source account". The transaction will use
    the current sequence number of the given account as its sequence number and increment the given account's
    sequence number by one. The given source account must include a private key for signing the transaction or
    an error will be thrown.

    Be careful about **unsubmitted transactions**! When you build a transaction, stellar-sdk automatically
    increments the source account's sequence number. If you end up not submitting this transaction and submitting
    another one instead, it'll fail due to the sequence number being wrong. So if you decide not to use a built
    transaction, make sure to update the source account's sequence number with :meth:`stellar_sdk.Server.load_account`
    before creating another transaction.

    :param source_account: The source account for this transaction.
    :param network_passphrase: The network to connect to for verifying and retrieving additional attributes from.
        Defaults to **Test SDF Network ; September 2015**.
    :param base_fee: Base fee in stroops. The network base fee is obtained by default from the latest ledger.
        Transaction fee is equal to base fee times number of operations in this transaction.
    :param v1: When this value is set to True, V1 transactions will be generated,
        otherwise V0 transactions will be generated.
