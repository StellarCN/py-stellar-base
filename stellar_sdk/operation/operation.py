    Stellar's network.

    An operation is an individual command that mutates Stellar's ledger. It is
    typically rolled up into a transaction (a transaction is a list of
    operations with additional metadata).

    Operations are executed on behalf of the source account specified in the
    transaction, unless there is an override defined for the operation.

    For more on operations, see `Stellar's documentation on operations
    <https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/operations.html>`_ as
    well as `Stellar's List of Operations
    <https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/list-of-operations.html>`_,
    which includes information such as the security necessary for a given
    operation, as well as information about when validity checks occur on the
    network.

    The :class:`Operation` class is typically not used, but rather one of its
    subclasses is typically included in transactions.

        transaction's source account.

        scaled down by a factor of ten million (10,000,000) to arrive at the
        native 64-bit integer representation. For example, the integer amount

        allows for seven decimal places of precision in human-friendly amount
