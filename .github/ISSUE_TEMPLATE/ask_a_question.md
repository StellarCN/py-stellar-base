If you want to get programming help, I suggest you check out our 
[developer documentation](https://stellar-sdk.readthedocs.org/) and [examples](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base/tree/master/examples) first. After that, if your problem 
is still not resolved, you can ask questions here 
or in [Stellar Stack Exchange](https://stellar.stackexchange.com).
